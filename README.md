## Abstract
Although research on emotion classification has significantly progressed in high-resource languages, it is still infancy for resource-constrained languages like Bengali. However, unavailability of necessary language processing tools and deficiency of benchmark corpora makes the emotion classification task in Bengali more challenging and complicated. This work proposes a transformer-based technique to classify the Bengali text into one of the six basic emotions: anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, and surprise.  A Bengali emotion corpus consists of 6243 texts is developed for the classification task. Experimentation carried out using various machine learning (LR, RF, MNB, SVM), deep neural networks (CNN, BiLSTM, CNN+BiLSTM) and transformer (Bangla-BERT, m-BERT, XLM-R) based approaches. Experimental outcomes indicate that XLM-R outdoes all other techniques by achieving the highest weighted f_1-score of 69.73\% on the test data.

## Contribution

- Develop a Bengali emotion corpus consisting of 6243 text documents with manual annotation to classify each text into one of six emotion classes: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 
- Investigate the performance of various ML, DNN and transformer-based approaches on the corpus.
- item Proposed a benchmark system to classify emotion in Bengali text with the experimental validation on the corpus.
